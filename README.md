# 👋 Hi, I'm Toussaint

Software Engineer with experience in **enterprise systems, quantum software, and web development** (backend & frontend).  
Currently consulting with [FjellTopp](https://fjelltopp.org).

I enjoy building **targeted projects** that deepen my understanding of programming languages, data structures, and machine learning.

### 💼 Selected Projects

- [**Avalon**](https://github.com/avalon-lang/) — a programming language with a tree-walk interpreter and quantum extensions.  
- [**Proto**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/proto) — a lightweight prototyping language.  
- [**C Collections**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/ccollections) — a C library of data structures.  
- [**CLAI**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/clai/) — an experimental natural-language shell using RAG + small LLMs. 

### 📕 Writing

I blog at [ntwalibas.github.io](https://ntwalibas.github.io/) on programming and research.  

Highlights:  
- [Quantum designs](https://ntwalibas.github.io/blog/2024/03/08/introduction-to-quantum-designs/) — approachable explanation of a dense topic.  
- [Reflections on CLI tools](https://ntwalibas.github.io/blog/2025/10/02/reflections-on-command-line-interface-tools/) — lessons on better CLI design. 

### 💡 Current Focus

- Exploring **local-first AI** with small language models.  
- Notes on **transformers** and **low-level computing (integers, assembly)**.
