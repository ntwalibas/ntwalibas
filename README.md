# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Toussaint

Software Engineer with experience in **enterprise systems, quantum software, and web development** (backend & frontend).  
Currently consulting with [FjellTopp](https://fjelltopp.org).

I enjoy building **targeted projects** that deepen my understanding of programming languages, data structures, and machine learning.

### ðŸ’¼ Selected Projects

- [**Avalon**](https://github.com/avalon-lang/) â€” a programming language with a tree-walk interpreter and quantum extensions.  
- [**Proto**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/proto) â€” a lightweight prototyping language.  
- [**C Collections**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/ccollections) â€” a C library of data structures.  
- [**CLAI**](https://github.com/ntwalibas/clai/) â€” an experimental natural-language shell using RAG + small LLMs. 

### ðŸ“• Writing

I blog at [ntwalibas.github.io](https://ntwalibas.github.io/) on software engineering.  

Highlights:  
- [Quantum designs](https://ntwalibas.github.io/blog/2024/03/08/introduction-to-quantum-designs/) â€” approachable explanation of a topic I found dense when learning it.  
- [Reflections on CLI tools](https://ntwalibas.github.io/blog/2025/10/02/reflections-on-command-line-interface-tools/) â€” my thoughts on designing better CLI tools. 

### ðŸ’¡ Current Focus

- Exploring **local-first AI** with small language models.  
- Notes on **transformers** and **low-level computing (integers, assembly)**.
